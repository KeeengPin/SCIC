# SCIC
This project contains a single Jupyter Notebook file: main.ipynb, which includes 
the complete code for all algorithms. Each method is preceded by a markdown cell 
with the method's name for easy navigation.

 Setup Instructions:  
 1. Install Required Libraries   
 Run the following command to install the necessary Python packages:  
 pip install nibabel numpy matplotlib scipy scikit-image pywavelets

 This command is already included in the first cell of main.ipynb.

 3. Prepare MRI Data  
 Ensure you have a 3D MRI file in .nii, .nii.gz, or .mnc.gz format.
 Sample data from BrainWeb is already included in the project folder.

 4. Launch the Notebook 
 Open main.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook.

 5. Set File Paths  
 Edit the relevant file paths in the notebook to match your local directory 
structure.

 6. Run the Code  
 You can run all cells sequentially to execute the complete workflow.  
 Alternatively, you can run any individual method, but make sure to first execute 
the dependency cell (present as the second cell in the notebook), which sets up 
the shared variables and data structures
